There is no doubt that we cannot make a product which the technology giants fail. To complete the final report, we made an alternative product, the innovative blood glucose meter implementing the data process and presentation on the cloud server. During that period, many problems including how to react with glucose enzymes, the preparation of test strip electrodes, the design of circuit boards for detecting the current of chemical reactions, the deployment of cloud services, and the design of multi-platform user interfaces have brought me great challenges. In order to solve these problems, I push myself to study circuit analysis courses and analog circuit courses, understood the concept of blood glucose concentration, etc. There is an old saying in China, ‘When three are walking together, I am sure to find teachers among them.’ To learn circuit board patching and drawing, I worked as an apprentice in a mobile phone repair shop for a month. During the stumble , we designed and obtained an appearance patent for a new type of blood glucose meter and applied for an invention patent for a system integrating cloud software and hardware.
