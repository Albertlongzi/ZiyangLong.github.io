In that period, many problems including the design of circuit boards for detecting the current of chemical reactions and the deployment of cloud services have brought me great challenges. In order to solve these problems, I pushed myself to study courses relevant to analog circuit analysis. To learn circuit board patching and drawing (PCB design), I even worked as an apprentice in a shop repairing mobile phone for a month. This experience not only makes me proficient in patching, but also reminds me that school is not the exclusive place for study. Practical experience is as important as theory learnt in the class. After trials and errors, we designed and obtained an appearance patent for a new type of blood glucose meter and applied for an invention patent for a glucose monitor system integrating both cloud software and hardware.
